## **I - Introduction**

<p>Not only are friendships an integral part of the journey of life but they also spark the initial interaction between potential romantic partners and continue to develop over time in tandem. Surrounding yourself with potential partners can be  the path to romance that brings more positivity into your life.</p>
<p>We created <strong>PineApple</strong> to promote “virtual dating”, a set of practices and symbolic meanings that prioritize visual, synchronous digital interaction as the most responsible, reliable, and successful dating approach to the pandemic. PineApple is more than an app, it is a movement. We encourage everyone to establish healthy connections and prescribe modes of use aimed toward affective relief, displays of authenticity, and romantic courtship.</</p>

## **II - Target users and environments**

<p>Our target group of users consists of young adults from all kinds of professions, whether they are college students or office workers. To be specific, those are the people who find it essential to make a meaningful connection. Through PineApple, we encourage people to establish healthy connections and meet lots of potential partners.</p>

## **III - Key features**
<ol>
<li><strong>Registration</strong>
<p>A set of credentials, including a username and password is used to gain access to the system requiring proper authorization.
Registration only happens the first time users access the system, which is a way to check their credentials. After their initial registration, it is compulsory to log on to the system using the username and password created.
The user can also configure their hobbies so that the system can suggest a list of other users with similar interests.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>
<p>Aside from signing in the system using Email, users can choose to sign in with their already existing Google or Facebook account and use the provided information for PineApple.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Swipe - Match</strong>
	<p>Shows avatar image, bio text, tag-hobbies (prefered speaking topic) audio description only who is active. When a user swipes right, the server will send notification to that person requesting connection, swiping left for loading another active user. When two users swipe right each other, they will be considered a match. This means they can chat or call each other.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Rewind</strong>
<p>Sometimes, users may swipe left someone by accident. However, this is not a problem as the Rewind feature can help by retrieving the most recently left swiped user so that the main user can reconsider and swipe again.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>View Likes</strong>
<p>The user can see a list of users who have liked them, or those whom the user likes. From there, they gain access to the other users’ profiles.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Top Picks</strong>
<p>This feature functions exactly like the normal Swipe. The only difference lies in how both arrange the suggested list of users. Top Picks offers the user two options: Common Passion and Key Opinion Leaders. Common Passion is where the user finds their perfect match who has the exact same hobbies, no more or less, while Key Opinion Leaders contains those who are liked by people the most.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>News</strong>
<p>Although not required, users may find it useful to read breaking news inside PineApple, while discussing said interesting news with their matches.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Hot Takes - Geology</strong>
<p>Users may find it interesting to discover potential matches nearby. This feature opens up a map provided by Google, while displaying potential users as pins that contain their information and distance.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Chat Support</strong>
<p>Sometimes, users may swipe left someone by accident. However, this is not a problem as the Rewind feature can help by retrieving the most recently left swiped user so that the main user can reconsider and swipe again.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Message</strong>
<p>One of the major features of PineApple. Matches can start chatting with each other about various topics, their life events and share their most interesting and appealing photos.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Video Call</strong>
<p>To make the conversation more engaging, both matched users can make video calls where they can talk directly just like talking in real life. They may hide their cameras or mute their microphones if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Safety Toolkit</strong>
<p>Getting matched with someone is not always a good sign. The other user may harass or cause annoyance to the main user in various ways. The good news is, they don’t have to endure this, and can easily Unmatch with the user, or Block the user, after which they can Unblock at their leisure.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Report</strong>
<p>As mentioned in Safety Toolkit, some people may act inappropriately to others. Beside Safety Toolkit, users gain access to Report, which suggests a list of unsuitable behaviors for them to choose, or write themselves.
<p>After a user has received at least 3 reports by different users, their account will be automatically deactivated until further actions are taken by the administrators.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Edit Profile</strong>
<p>After account registration, users can configure additional information such as their biography, phone number or hobbies. To show more about their appearance or talents, they can post more photos to their profile. However, the profile only contains at most 4 photos so as to encourage users to upload the ones with the highest qualities.</p>
<p>Users can configure their privacy by enabling or disabling the options to show their birthdate or distance.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Filter</strong>
<p>Users can tell how they want the system to suggest their potential matches by modifying the options such as Which gender that the users want to see, the distance between them and the potential matches and the age range of the potential matches.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Manage Passwords</strong>
<p>Users request the system to send a password reset email if they forget their password, or change it directly by entering both the old and new ones.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Delete Account</strong>
<p>When a user has no further interest in PineApple and plans to never return, they may delete their account. To ensure that they are the one who does it, the system will require them to enter the password one last time.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Push Notifications</strong>
<p>Users might be busy when they get a match with somebody, which is essential to inform them. Therefore, whenever they get a match, the system will push a notification on their phone, even if the application is not running on the foreground.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong>
<p>Users can explore beyond the Swipe or Top Picks screen. By using the search function, they can find other users who may not even share the same hobbies.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Activity History</strong>
<p>This feature may come in handy, where the user can view all their past activities, such as liking or disliking someone, getting a match, editing their profile, blocking someone,...</p>
</li>
